The focus of the course is on both theoretical and empirical work. The course will evaluate the main theoretical models and their applications. Increasingly issues in microstructure are empirical in nature, and we will spend time on the empirical approaches used in such research. Because information issues are fundamental to many of the issues covered, this course should be of interest to students in Finance, Economics, and Accounting. This course is structured to introduce students to interesting research problems in the securities markets.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":364608,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NRE","catalogNbr":"5210","titleShort":"Doctoral Pro Sem Marketing","titleLong":"Doctoral Pro Seminar - Marketing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17824,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08\/25\/2015","endDt":"12\/04\/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":10,"netid":"sg248","firstName":"Sachin","middleName":"","lastName":"Gupta"},{"instrAssignSeq":11,"netid":"vk24","firstName":"Vrinda","middleName":"","lastName":"Kadiyali"},{"instrAssignSeq":16,"netid":"sk766","firstName":"Soo","middleName":"Yeon","lastName":"Kim"},{"instrAssignSeq":12,"netid":"cl2278","firstName":"Clarence","middleName":"","lastName":"Lee"},{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"vrr2","firstName":"Vithala","middleName":"R.","lastName":"Rao"},{"instrAssignSeq":18,"netid":"jer9","firstName":"J.","middleName":"","lastName":"Russo"},{"instrAssignSeq":13,"netid":"dms43","firstName":"Douglas","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Stayman"},{"instrAssignSeq":14,"netid":"mkt27","firstName":"Manoj","middleName":"","lastName":"Thomas"},{"instrAssignSeq":15,"netid":"smv64","firstName":"Stijn","middleName":"","lastName":"van Osselaer"}],"pattern":"F","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Non-Johnson Students ONLY:  August 10th at 8:00am to September 8th at 4:00pm.

Topics will naturally vary from one offering of the course to the next. This course is intended for doctoral students in marketing and other doctoral students who are interested in choosing marketing as a minor. Each professor will conduct one or two sessions in the semester. The sessions will present an overview of one or two substantive topics of interest to the professor and the relevant research methods. Students will make presentations of research ideas or published papers in the last two sessions of the term. To receive credit for the course, students are required present a research topic in one of the last sessions of the term and submit a paper on that topic.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":365473,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NRE","catalogNbr":"5270","titleShort":"Doctoral Sem - Int'l Finance","titleLong":"Doctoral Seminar - International Finance","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":17832,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"05:40PM","startDt":"08\/25\/2015","endDt":"10\/11\/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"wbb1","firstName":"Warren","middleName":"B.","lastName":"Bailey"}],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"**NO LATE ADD\/DROP WILL BE ALLOWED AFTER THE LAST DAY OF THE ADD\/DROP PERIOD (September 8th)\r\nAdd\/Drop Dates:  Non-Johnson Students:  September 1st at 8:00am to September 8th at 4:00pm.
