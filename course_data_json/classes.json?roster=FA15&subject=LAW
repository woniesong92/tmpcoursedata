Students are introduced to the models of mediation and the benefits and challenges of each, including a comparative analysis of evaluative, facilitative and transformative styles of mediation. In the second segment, students will examine the impact of federal and state laws on the process. Significant attention will be devoted to the use of mediation in the public and federal sectors and in public sector negotiation impasses. The course will also explore the use of mediation across industries, including construction, securities, and commercial disputes.\u00a0 The role of gender, race, culture, ethics and impasse in mediation will all be examined and incorporated into workshops and case studies. Through a series of workshops, students will have several opportunities to apply their knowledge of mediation and begin to develop the skills needed to become effective mediators.
