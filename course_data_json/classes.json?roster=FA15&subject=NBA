International finance is different in two basic respects: (1) the existence of multiple currencies adds risk to investment and financing decisions; (2) when corporations and portfolio investors cross international borders, both problems and opportunities arise. This course focuses on these issues and highlights how finance theory can be extended to address them. Students apply the basic principles of international finance to a variety of problems. The course helps students understand the ideas and research results of international finance and adapt what they learn to the practical problems in the increasingly globalized business world. The first part of the course outlines exchange rate volatility, barriers to international capital flows, and the value of international diversification.

Over the spring and summer largely fortune 500 companies are solicited for projects that students can work on during the fall semester, with three to five days during the semester of on-site interaction with client companies at their location or on campus. The projects are done by teams of students, typically four, supported by both the faculty and an experienced adviser. Lecture material covers the approach to structuring complex problems, conducting analytical work and developing conclusions and recommendations. Student teams are expected to communicate regularly with their clients and to have at least interim and final presentations.

Topics include: (1) investor psychological bias and irrational trading behavior, and how to overcome our own biases in stock trading; (2) limits of arbitrage and the risk of leveraged convergence trading; (3) stock index market timing (and why market timing is far more important in emerging markets around the world than in the US); (4) typical behavioral finance approaches in constructing outperforming stock portfolios (including value, momentum, size, earnings quality, corporate governance, effects of short-sale constraint, and many other effects); (5) applying behavioral finance concepts to understanding China's stock market (as an example of emerging equity markets).","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350459,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6120","titleShort":"Disruptive Technologies","titleLong":"Disruptive Technologies","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15846,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:10AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08\/25\/2015","endDt":"10\/11\/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dpg5","firstName":"Donald","middleName":"P.","lastName":"Greenberg"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"**Enrollment by Permission Only**\r\nContact Professor Radcliff (dpg5@cornell.edu) for approval to enroll.\r\nATTENDANCE AT FIRST CLASS IS MANDATORY OR YOU WILL BE DROPPED FROM THE CLASS.\r\nAdd\/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students: August 10th at 8:00am to September 8th at 4:00pm.

We expect that students will take this opportunity to \"make it real\" - eLab is not about starting theoretical companies, or theoretically exploring potential business ideas.

The quantitative trading strategies are based on time-series and cross-sectional return predictability on global financial assets such as equity indices, foreign currencies, commodities, and sovereign bonds. In particular, we study the fundamentals of commodity futures returns and momentum strategy on commodity investment, the carry trade and momentum strategy on currency investment, the volatility strategy on option investment. In addition to delivering trading strategies, we pay close attention to common risk factors behind these investment strategies. Special topics change from one year to another to reflect recent trends and practices in industry, and also the state-of-art research in academia.

These initiatives, commonly viewed as efforts in \"corporate social responsibility\" (CSR), stem from the growing conviction-among senior executives as well as other stakeholders-that business must be \"part of the solution\" of problems that threaten communities and even the planet itself. At the same time, corporations are not charities, and corporate managers must strive (within legal and ethical constraints) to serve the interests of shareholders. Consequently, firms that engage in CSR must find ways to meet social needs and protect the natural environment that are in line with the companies' strategic goals. Drawing from the recent literature on CSR, this course uses articles and book excerpts to acquaint students with current ideas and best practices in the field. The readings are generally supplemented by at least one guest speaker from a leading corporate practitioner of CSR. Class discussion of case studies gives students the chance to analyze CSR challenges confronted by specific companies and to identify and critically evaluate possible responses to those challenges. A final project, assigned to two-person teams, entails students' developing recommendations-supported by detailed analysis-for a particular company in its pursuit of \"strategic CSR.\"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350667,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6630","titleShort":"Managerial Decision Making","titleLong":"Managerial Decision Making","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":13820,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:25PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08\/25\/2015","endDt":"12\/04\/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"jer9","firstName":"J.","middleName":"","lastName":"Russo"}],"pattern":"W","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***JOHNSON AND GRAD STUDENTS ONLY*** \r\nAdd\/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students: August 10th at 8:00am to September 8th at 4:00pm.

In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships. In today's volatile and fiercely competitive business environment, a manager must be able to identify and effectively resolve ethical issues that inevitably arise in the pursuit of business (and career) objectives. This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350704,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6730","titleShort":"Derivatives Securities Part I","titleLong":"Derivatives Securities Part I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15821,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"08\/25\/2015","endDt":"10\/11\/2015","instructors":[],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***GM, GRAD and UG SRS\/JRS ONLY***.  \r\nAdd\/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students: August 10th at 8:00am to September 8th at 4:00pm.

This course provides an introduction to basic derivatives such as futures, swaps, and options. We deal with the issue of pricing derivative securities by simple arbitrage arguments, and develop a framework for analyzing and using financial derivatives in various applications. By the end of the course, you should have a good understanding of commonly used derivatives in practice. Although the study of financial instruments is inherently quantitative, we focus on economic intuitions and interpretations behind derivative securities while keeping mathematic derivations minimal.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: NCC 5060\u00a0or permission of instructor.","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":350711,"crseOfferNbr":1,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6740","titleShort":"Derivatives Securities Part II","titleLong":"Derivatives Securities Part II","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":15918,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:40AM","timeEnd":"11:25AM","startDt":"10\/12\/2015","endDt":"12\/04\/2015","instructors":[],"pattern":"R","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"***GM, GRAD and UG SRS\/JRS ONLY***.\r\nAdd\/Drop Dates:  Johnson Students August 10th thru September 8th with an additional Add\/Drop period beginning October 14th at 8:00am to October 20th at 4:00pm. \r\nNon-Johnson Students:  October 19th at 8:00am to October 20th 4:00pm.

Second, we will explore corporate securities such as common equity, warrants, callable bond, puttable bond, and convertible bond. Finally, we will discuss credit risk and credit derivatives such as credit default swaps (CDS). We use real-world cases to illustrate important applications of derivatives.
