Each class focuses on a specific topic, such as Amsterdam as a cultural center and the country's capital, modes of transportation, architecture, immigration issues and history of Amsterdam. Students will read texts at home and discuss them in class; regularly read Amsterdam's newspaper Het Parool; watch short TV clips. At the end of each class, we will watch an episode of a popular Dutch TV show which has Amsterdam as its center; students will write a blog about each episode and design a wiki about Amsterdam. Attention will be paid to advanced grammar issues and vocabulary.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"Satisfies Option 1.","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"This course is part of the Shared Course Initiative and will be taught from Columbia University using videoconferencing technology.
