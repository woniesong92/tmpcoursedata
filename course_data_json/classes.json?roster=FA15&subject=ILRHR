It is designed to lay the foundations of good empirical research. While students will be exposed to a variety of quantitative and qualitative methodological techniques, the course emphasizes the assumptions and the logic underlying social science research. The course will cover specific topics such as sampling, measurement, reliability, and validity. Students will learn a variety of approaches to research design, have experience critiquing research studies, and, by the end of the term, be equipped to make informed research design choices.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall or spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"Enrollment limited to: Ph.D candidates only.","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"GR","acadGroup":"IL"}]},"message":null,"meta":{"copyright":"Cornell University, Office of the University Registrar","rosterDttm":"2015-04-04T18:16:02-0400","catalogDttm":"2015-04-04T18:21:44-0400"}}
