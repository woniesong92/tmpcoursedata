We move from the initial \"encounters\" of peoples from Africa and Iberia with the \"New World,\" the creation of long-distance trade with, and settlement in, Asia, and the establishment of colonial societies, through to the movements for independence in most of mainland Spanish America in the early 19th century and to the collapse of Spanish rule in the Pacific and Caribbean later that century. Through lectures, discussions and the reading of primary sources and secondary texts, the course examines the economic and social organization of the colonies, intellectual currents and colonial science, native accommodation and resistance to colonial rule, trade networks and imperial expansion, labor regimes and forms of economic production, and migration and movement.","catalogBreadth":"(GHB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"strm":2608,"crseId":359454,"crseOfferNbr":2,"subject":"LATA","catalogNbr":"2150","titleShort":"Contemporary Lat Am Survey","titleLong":"Contemporary Latin American Survey","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":6604,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"02:55PM","timeEnd":"04:10PM","startDt":"08\/25\/2015","endDt":"12\/04\/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":9,"netid":"bb228","firstName":"Bruno","middleName":"","lastName":"Bosteels"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Prerequisite: Spanish 2070 or 2090, or CASE Q+, or permission of instructor."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08\/25\/2015","endDt":"12\/04\/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":4,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["SEM"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Student Option","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"SPAN","catalogNbr":"2150","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"08\/25\/2015","sessionEndDt":"12\/04\/2015","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Readings and discussion of representative texts of the 19th and 20th centuries from various regions of Latin America.
