The course progresses through a sequence of the basic rudiments of the language, including an introduction to the script and its romanization, pronunciation (central Lhasan dialect), normative dictionary order, and the basic categories of grammar. Following these preliminaries, students proceed to guided readings in Tibetan literature designed to introduce them to the formal approach of Tibetan lexical semantics with an emphasis on the role of verbs in determining argument realization options. Over the duration of the course, students encounter new vocabulary (and associated Buddhist concept hierarchies) and increasingly complex sentence structures. This course thus provides a solid foundation for the later exploration of other genres of literature and styles of composition.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogLang":"","catalogForbiddenOverlaps":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Taught through distance learning using video-conferencing technology from Columbia University.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogFee":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"TIBET 1121-1122\u00a0will NOT fulfill the language requirement.","catalogPermission":"","catalogCourseSubfield":"","catalogOutcomes":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"}]},"message":null,"meta":{"copyright":"Cornell University, Office of the University Registrar","rosterDttm":"2015-04-04T18:16:02-0400","catalogDttm":"2015-04-04T18:21:44-0400"}}
